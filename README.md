# Claude upskill

Claude artificial intelligence upskill pathway recommendations.

This page focuses on:

- Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for professionals who are training.

- Specifically how to upskill from manual testing to automatic testing.

- Starting with how to upskill from complete novice to beginner competence.

## Objective 1: Upskill from manual testing to automatic testing

Time estimate: 40-80 hours DOE

Cost estimate: $20-$150/month for a Claude license such as personal pro up to enterprise all-in

Completion estimate: 80% of professionals who try will complete

Key Result 1: Upskill from zero knowledge to beginner. In terms of United Kingdom (UK) GDAD level, this means from 0 (i.e. no skill) to 1 (i.e. describe the fundamentals of the skill; demonstrate basic knowledge of some of the skill's tools capabilities and techniques). Measure by level-item i.e. level 0 -> level 1 item 1 -> level 1 item 2.

Key Result 2: Complete the Anthropic Claude learning items as described below. Measure by % of items complete.

Key Result 3: Successfully create and run automatic tests using fictitious data as described below. Measure by % of items complete.

- [ ] Create custom Skills

Tools & Integrations: streamline your workflow by connecting to your favorite tools

- [ ] Connect your tools to unlock a smarter, more capable AI companion

- [ ] Use the GitHub integration

## Successfully create and run automatic tests

- [ ] Use the assistant to enter manual tests for given examples that use
  fictitious programs and fictitious data, then generate browser automation
  tests using your preference of popular browser automation tooling (e.g.
  Selenium, Playwright, etc.) and programming language (e.g. TypeScript, Python,
  etc).

- [ ] Create and maintain Claude AGENTS.md file for handling your context and
  your training, including how to tune agentic coaching for your professional
  goals and ways of working.

- [ ] Create and maintain multiple SKILLS.md files for specific purposes,
  including skills such as writing browser automation code, and how to program
  in general, and how to generate data.

- [ ] Generate personal training guidance, including definitions,
  explanations,references, links to relevant books, web pages, videos, and
  course.

- [ ] Generate browser automation tests for example test cases, and publish the
  results to your personal GitHub. This includes learning enough about GitHub to
  be able to publish your own repository.

- [ ] Generate and run browser automation tests for the public live web example
  at testingexamples.github.io [and two more TBD]. This includes navigating to a
  web page, finding text on it, filling in form inputs, submitting, and
  confirming the result. Publish the results to your personal GitHub.

- [ ] Set up a coworker who doesn't know Claude, to give them a 1-hour tour of
  your learning, where you demonstrate the code and data. The purpose of this is
  to prove you're able to cross-train i.e. share your knowledge with your
  teammates.
